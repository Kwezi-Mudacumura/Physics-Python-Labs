<h1>Physics computer lab coding projects:</h1>
<h2>Background</h2>
  <p>A part of physics I was the lab assignments which consists of two components:<ul>
    <li>Lab reports from the physical experiments</li>
    <li>Computer lab where we had to code in python what was instructed to us</li>
  </ul>
</br>
Below is the code which I submitted for my physics labs. Please note the programs take no user input and its sole purpose is to output using the values I as the program gives the application in the code.
All these programs use python and runs on trinket exclusively
  </p>
<ul>
  <li><h3>Mercury computer lab2:</h3> </br>This program purpose is to shows Mercury being moved towards Earth in space.  </li>
  <li><h3>Computer lab3: </h3> </br>This program purpose is to show a ball bounces in a box.Its path is also displayed as output.   </li>
  <li><h3>Computer lab4:</h3> </br> This programs purpose is to show how two stars orbit each other in space.</li>
</ul>
